<h1>Watercolor tips</h1>
 
   <p >Watercolor is more of an abstract medium. Thats why when starting out its best to sketch lightly. 
    Its also important to start lighter with your colors. Its better to start with a light base and 
    add details with a darker color. To get a lighter color, you will need more
    water. And to achieve darker colors you will need less water. And to avoid muddy paint and mixing 
    colors, you need to wait for layers to dry before you add another one. </p>
